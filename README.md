 Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups of individuals, organizations,
 or entities that share similar characteristics, needs, or behaviors. This enables businesses to better understand their customers 
 and tailor their offerings, marketing, and strategies to meet the unique needs of each segment.
